# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# product = Product.new(
#   name: "rug",
#   price: 50,
#   description: "floor covering that covers part of your floor",
#   image_url: "https://images.thdstatic.com/productImages/5fec94d4-a763-4a86-b020-88b160da45e2/svn/light-grey-area-rugs-djyc-g-b03047087-31_600.jpg"

# product.save
